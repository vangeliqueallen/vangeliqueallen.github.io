I am a graduate school candidate with a passion for cephalopod neurobiology and a broad interest in neural systems and behavior. I am currently studying how octopuses 'think about what they see', or in other words their visual processing. I am particularly interested in how they process a characteristic of light that we can't even see - polarization! Which simply put, is the angle at which a light wave travels. Octopuses are able to see this, and there is proof that other cephalopods are able to create and change the polarization of their skin. To study how octopuses process this information, I am using a big fancy (2-photon for those who are interested) laser to record neural activity (using injectable calcium dyes, again for those who care). 

Outside of the lab I absolutely love to travel, mostly to explore tidepools and rock climb, and spend time with my cat. I also create and lead various events that show children and their parents what it is like to be a scientist. I have introduced many of them to discovery based science, which is science that has nothing to do with human health of creating a product, but rather focuses on answering questions out of curiosity. Since starting graduate school, I have become very passionate about this because neither my parents or I knew that discovery based research existed until my junior year of college. While there are many outreach/sci com efforts that focus on children, I aim to inspire and educate children AND their familial support system so that when a second grader goes home and tells their parents they want to be an octopus brain scientist they aren't told 'thats not a real job'.
