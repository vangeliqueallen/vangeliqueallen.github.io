Angelique is a PhD candidate, HHMI Gilliam fellow, and a soon to be author with a drive to understand animal perception and a passion for putting science where people least expect it. She is currently studying how octopuses 'think about what they see', or their visual processing, at the University of Oregon in Cris Niell's lab.
