Hey there! My name is Angelique Allen (she/her), and I am a PhD candidate in the Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Oregon. I am broadly interested in animal perception, and I am currently studying how octopuses 'think about what they see', or their visual processing. I became absolutely fascinated by cephalopods as a junior at the University of Missouri, which was the same time that I learned about discovery-based research and learned to SCUBA dive. I wanted to combine my interest in the underwater world and curiosity in animal perception, and studying octopuses seemed like the perfect way to do that! 

While I love asking questions and making discoveries about animals that are so different from us, I think that actually making the discovery is just the first step you should take as a scientist. In order to educate and inspire the general public, we as scientists have to share our discoveries with a broader audience. I aim to do that by putting science where people least expect it, like in a children's book or on a beer label, and I am always coming up with new ideas to make that happen!
