Dreams of a Scientist: Lessons from the Sea is a childrenâ€™s picture book that that will take readers on an oceanic adventure full of scientific discovery. This book will:

1. Educate readers on recent discoveries that active scientists have made about incredible marine animals

2. Break stereotypes by introducing readers to real-life marine scientists from different backgrounds and in different career stages

I am currently in the process of self-publishing this book, and it will be available this summer! You can preorder it and learn more at [our website.](www.dreamsofascientist.com)
